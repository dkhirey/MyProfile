\section{ACHIEVEMENTS}

{\customcventry{}{\textbf{Intelligent Production Optimizer}}{Unit Finalist at TCS Innovista 2020}{September 2020}{}{}}
\paragraph{Manufacturing Operations are executed on Assembly Line based on Product Order Sequence provided by MES systems. These systems are capable of orchestrating steps to perform but there is no feedback mechanism to learn from historical executions.This innovation gives insights to the Production Manager on Line Balancing and Product Order Mix so that system can self identify and prescribe best sequence of orders that would take least time and improve assembly line productivity. }

{\customcventry{}{\textbf{Prediction of Logistical Delays of Delivery Trucks based on Real Time Telematics data}}{Winner of CTO Hackathon at Fiat Chrysler}{November 2019}{}{}}

\paragraph{This solution uses Apache Kafka as Streaming platform to ingest data from IoT Telematics REST Service to On-Prem PostgreSQL Data Lake at real time and perform Streaming Analytics with Apache Flink to predict ETA using Google Maps Platform. It enables business to monitor Supply Chain Delivery status and get alerts on possible delays in advance. Developed Custom HTTP Source connector using Confluent Hub as part of this hackathon.}
